UIU Mock MUN Conference 2023

The “UIU Mock MUN Conference 2023” is going to be organized by the UIU Model United Nations Club (UIUMUNC) in coordination with the Directorate of Career Counseling and Student Affairs (DCCSA) is a great opportunity for UIU students to experience a simulation of conventional MUN events.

Mock MUN conferences are valuable platforms for students to enhance their public speaking, leadership, and negotiation skills, as well as their ability to work collaboratively towards finding solutions to real-world problems. Participants will get chances to practice and refine their MUN skills before competing in actual MUN events.

The event scheduled for 2nd August 2023 (Wednesday) will likely be a memorable experience for the participants, as they engage in lively debates, draft resolutions, and address some of the world’s most pressing issues, emulating the dynamics of real MUN conferences.

Participating in this Mock MUN will not only help students gain confidence and proficiency in MUN-related activities but also allow them to cherish MUN memories that can be beneficial for their personal and academic growth.
